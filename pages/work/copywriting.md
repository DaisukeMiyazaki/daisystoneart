## SEO 
I worked as a copywriter for TENGA, Japan’s leading sexual health and wellness
brand. I wrote 2+ SEO-based blogs per week for their US e-commerce store in an
effort to increase brand awareness and web traffic in the United States.

- [4 Ways Sex Toys are Great for Your Relationship](https://usstore.tenga.co/blogs/category_masturbation/4-ways-sex-toys-are-great-for-your-relationship)

- [Why You Should Check Out the TENGA Bobble Crazy Cubes](https://usstore.tenga.co/blogs/category_sex-toys/why-you-should-check-out-the-tenga-bobble-crazy-cubes)

## Published articles (Creative)
I created (non-SEO based) content focused on sexual health & wellness for

### TENGA’s sister brand, iroha.

### E-Commerce Copy
I worked as a copywriter and translator for COVERCHORD, an E-Commerce
platform selling Japanese menswear, womenswear, and lifestyle goods. I wrote
original copy for all products sold on the site and assisted with copywriting for
lifestyle and product focused featured articles.
